# ðŸ”‘ KeyB2: Long Document Ranking with Block Selection

**KeyB2** is a long document ranking method designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM-based reranking by selecting the most relevant document blocks.

## ðŸ“Š Quick Evaluation (TREC DL 2019)

To evaluate the ranking results on the **TREC DL 2019 document ranking** dataset using `pyserini`, run the following command:

```bash
python -m pyserini.eval.trec_eval -c -m ndcg_cut.10 -m map dl19-doc ${rerankBaseName}.trec
```

The results of using pyserini can be seen in https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-zZU2WSj2P8FMZQc4pMpi84HYEPZKU7J?usp=sharing
(upload the two runs in the colab files, then run the code)

Code and other rerank files will be updated later.
